# A Note on numbered headings:  

*UPDATE* - none of these seem to be working.  
Oh well! I've got to focus on doing the actual work.  
Can always Toggle auto-numbering in Jupyter Lab.   
  
## Numbered headings in notebooks:
Used the following solutions:
* [From Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/discussions/getting-started/129348)

## numbered headings on GitHub Readme file  
As of August 2022, Github README files do not have numbered headings.

So, tried embeding CSS in a SVG and embed that SVG here.
